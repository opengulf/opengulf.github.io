**How to explore this map:** Click on the points to learn about the locations of date palms documented in John Gordon Lorimer’s of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia. The density and size of the green dots indicate the concentration of date palms in various regions. 


**Context:** This map’s dataset is based on values extracted from entries of the Geographical and Statistical section of Lorimer’s Gazetteer. 

**Geolocation:** The text of the entries were annotated in Recogito. The geographical coordinates are provided by GeoNames (with the GeoNames ID found in the dataset). 


**Notes on data decisions:** Through the extraction of text files from Lorimer’s Gazetteer, which reference keywords like "date," "date palms," and "date groves" across various locations, we have documented a total of 9,554,347 date palms. When a location is selected, it unveils the text file accompanied by the corresponding chapter from Lorimer's work that references it and numbers of dates identified. Additionally, integrates supplementary information such as latitude and longitude coordinates and alternate names (in Persian and Arabic languages) for enhanced context.

**Unidentified locations:**

We compiled a list of date palms for which we were unable to find the GeoNames ID, if you are able to identify the location on a map, reach out to us at opengulfNYUAD@gmail.com. We appreciate your assistance in this matter and will acknowledge your contribution to our research.
